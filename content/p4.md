Title: Sync Multiple AWS and Boto Credentials

If you work with multiple sets of AWS credentials and boto or boto-based tools
like [s3cat](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/s3cat/1.0.8), you may have noticed
that Boto doesn't use the same configuration as the AWS cli tools. The AWS CLI
tools look at `~/.aws/config`, and boto looks for `~/.aws/credentials`. Also,
the format is slightly different. I'm curious what other people do, but I've 
got a little  helper script I call `mkbotocreds` in my path:

    cp ~/.aws/config ~/.aws/credentials
    sed -i 's/profile //g' ~/.aws/credentials
    
This makes `~/.aws/config` the default config, and builds boto credentials
from the sections there. Just run it whenever you add or change credentials
in `~/.aws/config`.

The above should work breezy on Linux. If you're on OS X, though, you're going
to want to get yourself a proper version of `sed`:

    brew install gnu-sed --default-names
    
Trust me, you'll thank yourself later for making the change.

I also recommend using the [AWS plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/aws/aws.plugin.zsh)
for oh-my-zsh. Apply [this mod](https://github.com/ethanmcc/oh-my-zsh/commit/1d12cfa9b8b06df8019171c8c8565818c7654cc9)
to make sure your AWS and boto commands use the same profile within your shell
session.
