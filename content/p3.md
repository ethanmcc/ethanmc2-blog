Title: Static Blog Generation with Pelican

I initially put this blog together as a Django / Mezzanine site so I could
talk about the process of configuring it for Elastic Beanstalk at a 
[Bucks County DevOps meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bucks-County-DevOps/events/205196652/).
The process was fun and I liked Mezzanine, but at some point there was a
fiasco where I ended up getting an AWS bill for $350+ for a micro-based
Elastic Beanstalk environment. Amazon support was very helpful, and
immediately removed the charges plus a buffer to keep the site running so I 
could debug it, but I exceeded my extra coverage before I made time to
debug the problem.

I ended up just taking down the whole site until I had time to address the
issue. I was busy working on making [my brother's synthesizer module website](http://animodule.com)
mobile-friendly before his trip to NAMM. The truth is, though, I still don't
have time to debug it. If this was a work glitch, I would put the pieces in
place to make sure I understood why the EBS storage was getting hit so hard,
but since it's for my personal site and I intend to neglect the crap out of
it, I decided to serve a static site out of Amazon S3.
 
The initial plan was to distill the existing Mezzanine site, or put it
behind CloudFront, but when I ran into problems with the available
Mezzanine static site generator, I decided to call that whole thing quits and
checkout [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/). It was remarkably easy to get
working and into S3, and now here my blog is in its second incarnation.
