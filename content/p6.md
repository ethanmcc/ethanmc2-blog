Pythonistas: JavaScript has us beat. Grunt and Gulp both have
[better](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)
[support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-watch)
for watching file changes and automatically running your test suite. Python
has done ok over the years with tools like tdaemon, rerun, and watchdog, each
of which serves a solid purpose, but the tools are difficult to invoke on 
their own.

[tdaemon](https://github.com/brunobord/tdaemon)
offers a very usable CLI interface (`tdaemon -t django`) and supports
[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with Python 3,
[isn't maintained on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tdaemon),
and doesn't keep up speedwise with the event-based tools. If I could just
`pip install` it it'd be back in the running for sure.

[rerun](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rerun/)'s
ignore syntax is pretty much impossible to master. It triggers a build every
time I navigate through a file using vim and it writes a .swp file, despite
the extensive set of flags I pass on invocation. I give up. Also, it doesn't
play well with virtualenv, at least for running manage.py scripts, and I end
up passing the full path to my virtualenv binary.

[watchdog](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog)
is probably the best, but still requires more flags than I want to enter as I
bounce between several different Django-based projects. It is, however, the
backbone of my new favorite test watcher and runner,
[py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/).

I know py.test isn't new, but I didn't realize I could run my Django test
suite from py.test without changing a line of code. From now on, I'm pip
installing pytest,
[pytest-django](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-django/), and
[pytest-watch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-watch/2.0.0)
in my development environments. You'll need a barebones pytest.ini
(or a
[pytest section in your `tox.ini`](https://pytest.org/latest/customize.html))
as well:

    [pytest]
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=path.to.settings

From there on out, though, you can just let `ptw` do all the work. Just start
the test watcher and get to TDD-ing.
