Title: A Whole Lot of Nothing

I took a little bit of time away from computers and ended up in west Texas
for some camping and exploring of desert towns. One of the most incredible
things I experienced was a
[star party](http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/visitors/programs/star-parties)
at McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis.

I expected a handful of people there, but it must have been hundreds of people
making their way up the dimly-lit path to an outdoor presentation area with
several rows of stone benches. There were people of all ages, even some in
wheelchairs. It started with a guided tour of the constellations that were
visible. There were a lot, as it was a very clear night with a new moon.

Using a laser guide that you could follow all the way up to the stars, the
guide pointed out how to find one constellation from another, starting with
the big dipper. I made mental notes about all kinds of constellations, but I'm
hopeful that I'll be able to identify Scorpius the next time I'm somewhere
with a clear enough sky to make out the stars.

After the constellation tour, there were small lines at around a dozen
telescopes, some setup in domes, to view nebulae, Andromeda, Saturn and its
rings, Uranus, and several other phenomena. The event piqued my interest in the
stars, and I will be looking for other star parties around Philadelphia and
when I'm near the Smokey Mountains in a week or so.
